# Movie-Query

## Synopsis

A React SPA using [the movie database API](https://www.themoviedb.org) to display movie information. This project is still new and the major features have not been implemented yet.

### Planned features:

- Movie lookup and details
- Actor lookup and details
- Advanced Search Options
- Find popular actors
- Find popular movies
- Compare two (or more) movies casts for actors in both movies

## Live Code

This project is still under development. The current version can be found at https://curtisfulton.github.io/Movie-Query. 

### Version 1

This is still a very early build. Currently there are 3 pages that work.

- "Home" shows trending movies. 
- "Movies" shows popular movies (which are usually pretty similar to the trending ones)
- "Actors" shows popular actors

- "Search" Is currently not implemented.

## Skills/Technologies

- React
- Public RESTful API interaction
- Dynamic webpage creation

## Motivation

I have never tried making an application using any API other than one I wrote myself, so I decided to use the movie database as a way to learn how to do that. By looking at the way other people make their API's I will be able to make my own ones better.

I chose React for this project because in the past I have only used Vue.js as a front end framework and wanted to try something new. It was between Angular2 and React, but because this project is relatively small I decided on against Angular2.
